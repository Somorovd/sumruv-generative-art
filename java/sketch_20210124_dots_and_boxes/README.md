# Dots and Boxes
Jumping off point was the combined prompts from Genuary days 23-25. Eventually turned into artistic piece based on the game Dots and Boxes. 
* Day 23: #264653 #2a9d8f #e9c46a #f4a261 #e76f51, no gradients
* Day 24: 500 lines
* Day 25: make a grid of permutations of something

# Process
1. Define a major grid and minor grid. Minor grid for a single 'game' and the major grid for all the games.
2. Create boxes for each cell of the minor grid.
3. Some n number of times, randomly choose a box and a side that has not yet been chosen.
4. Draw all the chosen lines.
5. For every box with all 4 chosen sides, draw a colored square.
