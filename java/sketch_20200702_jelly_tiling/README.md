# Jelly Tiling

Most beginner projects use strict geometric shapes because they are the easiest to draw. The Chaikin corner cutting algorithm ([ref](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~dm/UNC/COMP258/LECTURES/Chaikins-Algorithm.pdf))
is  simple technique for smoothing shapes with corners through a series of interpolations. This project uses that algorithm to make random blobs.
