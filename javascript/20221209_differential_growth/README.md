# Differential Growth
An algorithm that mimics the growth of natural organisms, trying to spread out and not clump together.

# Process
In each iterative step after initialization:
1. For each point, find all the close points and determine the direction this point will be pushed in.
2. Move all the points according to step 1.
3. For any two connected points with a distance higher than the threshold, create a new point in between.
