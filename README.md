# Generative Art - Sumruv

I'm starting by going through my local files to get a backup on GitHub and add to my portfolio. I will tidy them up and add a README. Not everything is super interesting and polished so there may be many new projects that you wont find images of on my Twitter, which I usually reserve for projects Im very pleased by.
