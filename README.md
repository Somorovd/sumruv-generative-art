# Generative Art - Sumruv

Hello! Welcome to some code that makes art. 

I have quite a lot of code on my laptop from over the years that could really use some backing up. As I do that, I will try to tidy things up and add READMEs to explain things at a high level. There are a fair number of projects that never made it to Twitter due to being too simple and/or incomplete, but that ok around here. As long as you can find something interesting and I can demonstrate coding ability, thats a win in my book.
